Assignment 1 README

NOTE : Every code WILL FIT the 9 polynomials again. This makes the 3 code files independent of each other.
 
1. Makesure the Code and both the test and train set are in the same location.
2. Don't comment out '%matplotlib inline' if running on a IPython notebook. Otherwise, if it gives any errors please comment it out from the top of the code.
3. The Gradient descent algorithm stops when the defference between 2 consecutive error is 10e-10. The results pdfs are with this thresh_hold only.
   For faster processing you can change it at the top of every code. 'thresh_hold= 0.000000001'
4. However don't alter the thresh-hold for Q_3, since the explanation, which is typed in, is dependent on the plots, which in turn is dependent on the thresh_hold.
